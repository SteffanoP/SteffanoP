Here you can find many projects that I work on, there's also a lot of informative stuff about my college and other projects from

🔭 I’m currently working to build a community at [UFRPE-DEVS](https://github.com/ufrpe-devs/comunidade)!

📓 I've also researched about **Synthetic Dataset Generation** for one of my Undergraduate Research at Federal Rural University in colaboration with AiBoxLab Research Group. Take a look at [SteffanoP/cbdgen](https://github.com/SteffanoP/cbdgen-framework)!

🌱 But lately I've been exploring and learning more about **DevOps Culture** and **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**. For now, I've been learning about Cloud Providers, such as **Amazon AWS Services** and **Microsoft Azure**. 

🧐 Nonetheless, I've been also looking to automate workflows and pipelines, exploring technologies such as **GitHub Actions** to manage GitHub Repositories, as well as, **Hashicorp Terraform** to provision cloud resources in the Cloud and **Hashicorp Vault** to keep secrets safe!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects! If I fit into your project somehow, please contact me!

💬 Ask me about `{Git, Java, C, Arduino, Python, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Vault, AWS, Azure, [...]}`

📫 You can reach me by sending me an email or if you prefer send me a note at [in/SteffanoP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffanop/)

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and as you can see, I love Obi-Wan Kenobi! Such a great character that I hoped Disney could treat him better.
